json-to-sqlite
=====================

Json-to-sqlite is a tool that can take any number of json files and create a sqlite database. Json-to-sqlite is most useful as part of a build where a pre-shipped sqlite database is needed by your app bundle.

Limitations:
Relationships between tables is currently not supported. 

Usage:
```
dbbuilder __config_dir__ __schema_file__ __output__
```

* config_dir
  A directory containing a dbconfig.plist and json files.
    Each entry in the plist should be the name of a table in your schema.
    
* schema_file
  path to a core-data schema file (*.momd). File is generated by core data at build time.
  
* output.
  where to save output sqlite file.
